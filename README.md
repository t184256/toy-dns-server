# A toy DNS server written in Rust for learning purposes

Nothing about it is interesting in any way.
I just wanted to get comfortable dealing with simplistic Rust code
before tackling something more complicated.
The choice of the dependencies is also inadequate for learning purposes.

Oh, and it was written with AI assistance,
so probably don't borrow any code from it
or trust anything about it to hold true.

Design decisions: async.
